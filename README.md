# 🛡️ Threat Detection Model V1

A Roboflow-powered object detection model trained to identify civilian-grade drones from aerial imagery.  
Model V1 was developed as an entry-level research and annotation project to explore AI-driven threat detection within counter-UAS contexts.

## 🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates the full cycle of AI model development:
- Dataset design and annotation  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Metric tracking and visual performance analysis  

The model was trained on **200 annotated drone images** using **YOLOv5**, achieving strong detection accuracy despite the small dataset size.
