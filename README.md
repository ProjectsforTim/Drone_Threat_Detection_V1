## 🔍 Key Learnings
- Dataset quality and annotation accuracy heavily influence detection performance.  
- Even with limited training data, model V1 achieved robust detection reliability.  
- Lays groundwork for **Model V2**, which expanded to 1,200+ annotations and achieved mAP@0.5 = 0.979.

## 🧾 Reproducibility
This model is **fully reproducible** via the linked Colab notebook:  
[Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JtoRteMlE2KbhiwVHtgJV41LP9OUWLi8#scrollTo=bgmusWkjB0_e)

## ⚙️ Tools & Frameworks
- **YOLOv5** (ultralytics)  
- **Roboflow** for dataset management  
- **Google Colab** for training and evaluation  
- **Python 3.10**, Torch 2.x  

---

## 🛠️ Next Steps
- Expand dataset diversity (angles, distances, lighting conditions).  
- Implement Model V2 comparisons for benchmark visibility.  
- Prepare deployment-ready inference notebook for real-time detection scenarios.
